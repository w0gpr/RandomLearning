# RandomLearning
These are random learning scripts I've made and also learning to use Git

This has been added on VIM. 

I'm going to use this to upload some of my scripts that I randomly generate for projects. I use Matlab at the moment. Maybe oneday my github will evolve into a more useful format.

I have numerous scripts for various classes/projects including cosmogenic nuclide modeling.
